# Collisions
A Python program that generates particle collisions simulations.

Note: If you download the .mp4 files to check them out, you'll see that the collisions look like they happen before they should, and that's because the original file is in 60fps and GitHub for some reason lowers the framerate and so it looks off. The original video looks perfect.
